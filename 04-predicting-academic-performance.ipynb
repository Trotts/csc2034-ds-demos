    "In a previous notebook, I mentioned how hyparameters are values you need to set to allow your model to train. The values you set for these hyperparameters can greatly influence how well your model can generalise, preventing overfitting. But how do you know which hyperparameters to choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us decide which hyperparameters to pass to our models, we can utilise a process known as hyperparameter tuning. The simplest form of this is known as a Grid Search. During a Grid Search, we provide a list of values to try out for each hyperparameter. In practise a subset of hyperparameters are used, especially for deep learning models - in my research a grid search on a deep learning model took just over 1 month to finish using 2 GPUs!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform hyperparameter tuning, we don't want to expose our model to the test set as this may impact generalisation and stops us being able to produce a final evaluation on unseen data. With large datasets, often the train set will be split further into an evaluation set to get around this. The train set will be used for training, hyperparameter searches will be evaluated against the evaluation set, and the test set will be reserved for final evaluation on unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case however we have a small dataset. To allow us to still perform hyperparameter tuning we can utilise a concept known as Cross Validation. Again you will go into more detail in your lectures, but cross validation allows you to split your training set multiple times into N *folds*. Hyperparameter tuning is then performed on the combination of these folds. This gives us, in essence, both a training and validation set even though we have very little data to work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try some hyperparameter tuning using cross validation on our non-linear SVM and see if we can reduce our overfitting. Somewhat annoyingly, we now have a hyperparameter for our cross validation - the number of folds!\n",
    "\n",
